	// Invoked when the scheduler successfully registers with a Mesos
	// master. A unique ID (generated by the master) used for
	// distinguishing this framework from others and MasterInfo
	// with the ip and port of the current master are provided as arguments.
	Registered(sched.Scheduler, *mesos.FrameworkID, *mesos.MasterInfo)

	// Invoked when the scheduler re-registers with a newly elected Mesos master.
	// This is only called when the scheduler has previously been registered.
	// MasterInfo containing the updated information about the elected master
	// is provided as an argument.
	Reregistered(sched.Scheduler, *mesos.MasterInfo)

	// Invoked when the scheduler becomes "disconnected" from the master
	// (e.g., the master fails and another is taking over).
	Disconnected(sched.Scheduler)

	// Invoked when resources have been offered to this framework. A
	// single offer will only contain resources from a single slave.
	// Resources associated with an offer will not be re-offered to
	// _this_ framework until either (a) this framework has rejected
	// those resources (see SchedulerDriver::launchTasks) or (b) those
	// resources have been rescinded (see Scheduler::offerRescinded).
	// Note that resources may be concurrently offered to more than one
	// framework at a time (depending on the allocator being used). In
	// that case, the first framework to launch tasks using those
	// resources will be able to use them while the other frameworks
	// will have those resources rescinded (or if a framework has
	// already launched tasks with those resources then those tasks will
	// fail with a TASK_LOST status and a message saying as much).
	ResourceOffers(sched.Scheduler, []*mesos.Offer)

	// Invoked when an offer is no longer valid (e.g., the slave was
	// lost or another framework used resources in the offer). If for
	// whatever reason an offer is never rescinded (e.g., dropped
	// message, failing over framework, etc.), a framwork that attempts
	// to launch tasks using an invalid offer will receive TASK_LOST
	// status updates for those tasks (see Scheduler::resourceOffers).
	OfferRescinded(sched.Scheduler, *mesos.OfferID)

	// Invoked when the status of a task has changed (e.g., a slave is
	// lost and so the task is lost, a task finishes and an executor
	// sends a status update saying so, etc). Note that returning from
	// this callback _acknowledges_ receipt of this status update! If
	// for whatever reason the scheduler aborts during this callback (or
	// the process exits) another status update will be delivered (note,
	// however, that this is currently not true if the slave sending the
	// status update is lost/fails during that time).
	StatusUpdate(sched.Scheduler, *mesos.TaskStatus)

	// Invoked when an executor sends a message. These messages are best
	// effort; do not expect a framework message to be retransmitted in
	// any reliable fashion.
	FrameworkMessage(sched.Scheduler, *mesos.ExecutorID, *mesos.SlaveID, string)

	// Invoked when a slave has been determined unreachable (e.g.,
	// machine failure, network partition). Most frameworks will need to
	// reschedule any tasks launched on this slave on a new slave.
	SlaveLost(sched.Scheduler, *mesos.SlaveID)

	// Invoked when an executor has exited/terminated. Note that any
	// tasks running will have TASK_LOST status updates automagically
	// generated.
	ExecutorLost(sched.Scheduler, *mesos.ExecutorID, *mesos.SlaveID, int)

	// Invoked when there is an unrecoverable error in the scheduler or
	// scheduler driver. The driver will be aborted BEFORE invoking this
	// callback.
	Error(sched.Scheduler, string)
